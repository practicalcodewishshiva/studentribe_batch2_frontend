      ground with our technology. We kick-started operations on the 15th of
      August, 2010 with the goal of breaking all barriers that traders and
      investors face in India in terms of cost, support, and technology. We
      named the company Zerodha, a combination of Zero and "Rodha", the Sanskrit
      word for barrier. Today, our disruptive pricing models and in-house
      technology have made us the biggest stock broker in India. Over 1.6+ crore
      clients place billions of orders every year through our powerful ecosystem
      of investment platforms, contributing over 15% of all Indian retail
      trading volumes. In addition, we run a number of popular open online
      educational and community initiatives to empower retail traders and
      investors. Rainmatter, our fintech fund and incubator, has invested in
      several fintech startups with the goal of growing the Indian capital
      markets. And yet, we are always up to something new every day. Catch up on
